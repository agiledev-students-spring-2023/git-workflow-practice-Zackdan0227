The "Made in China 2025" plan is a comprehensive strategy introduced by the Chinese government in 2015 aimed at modernizing and upgrading the country's manufacturing sector. The industrial policy aims to upgrade the manufacturing capabilities of Chinese industries, growing from labor-intensive workshops into a more technology-intensive powerhouse. Would this change the stigma to "Made in China" as it brands poor quality products? 

With the advancement in artificial intelligence research, traditional labor seems to be less efficient when compared streamlines of automated robots. I wonder how this would affect China's job markets as the demand for labor shifts to high-tech work environments.

From China's perspective, I understand that they want to increase the standard of living and average GDP of their citizens. Understandably, the U.S. who has been a key player in the high-technology industry is worried, as they would have a new massive competitor in that space. I believe that China's job markets will be drastically shifted as there will be a new demand for people who understand these high-technology concepts and know how to develop high-technology products. I also believe that their education system will be drastically shifted, as it is very likely that kids in college and graduate school will be taught about these concepts in order to then be hired for these new jobs. I would be surprised and impressed if China could achieve their goals by 2025, given the international resistance they are facing from other countries and the fact that they have 2 years to do it.
