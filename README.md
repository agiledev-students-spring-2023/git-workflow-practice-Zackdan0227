The "Made in China 2025" plan is a comprehensive strategy introduced by the Chinese government in 2015 aimed at modernizing and upgrading the country's manufacturing sector. The industrial policy aims to upgrade the manufacturing capabilities of Chinese industries, growing from labor-intensive workshops into a more technology-intensive powerhouse. Would this change the stigma to "Made in China" as it brands poor quality products? 

With the advancement in artificial intelligence research, traditional labor seems to be less efficient when compared streamlines of automated robots. I wonder how this would affect China's job markets as the demand for labor shifts to high-tech work environments.
